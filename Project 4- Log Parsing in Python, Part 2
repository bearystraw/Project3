#We worked together on Brandon's computer and he typed it here on Github


#Question 1: How many requests were made on each day? 
      #To read our code, the answer is formatted as (year, month, day) followed by the number of requests each day.
            #1994-10-24: 705 requests
            #1994-10-25: 1194 requests
            #1994-10-26: 1679 requests

#Question 2:How many requests were made on a week-by-week basis? Per month?
      #Week 1:4860
      #Week 2:9105
      #Week 3:10787

#Question 3: What percentage of the requests were not successful (any 4xx status code)?
      #3.90% were not successful

#Question 4: What percentage of the requests were redirected elsewhere (any 3xx codes)?
      #17.68% of requests were redirected elsewhere

#Question 5: What was the most-requested file?
      #index.html was the most requested file with 139,785 requests total

#Question 6: What was the least-requested file
      #1 with 2 requests was the least-requested file
